            <article><p>Historians disagree about the invention of the bicycle, and many dates are challenged. It is most likely that no individual qualifies as the inventor and that the bicycle evolved through the efforts of many. Although Leonardo da Vinci was credited with having sketched a bicycle in 1492 in his Codex Atlanticus, the drawing was discovered to be a forgery added in the 1960s. Another presumed bicycle ancestor, the vélocifère, or célérifère, of the 1790s was a fast horse-drawn coach that is not considered to be a predecessor of the bicycle.

            <aside><p>Fitting a 26×2.4 tire in the chainstays was a challenge. A slight angle was bent in the chainstay and some crimping was done. Also, the chainstay was long which helped. It turned out that there is lots of room down there with a 2.4 tire when I finished. There were plenty of problems to solve in this project.
